# Agent Runtime Control Contracts

Status: Accepted  
Story: US-002  
Date: 2026-03-08

## Goal

Define the runtime-facing contract for planning, budget awareness, hidden tool-argument injection, sub-agent controls, HITL gating, MCP progress emission, and tool-result metadata before implementation work starts. The contract must round-trip cleanly across core `Agent` objects, runner execution, serialized configs, distributed workers, Temporal payloads, and Exo Web storage/runtime.

## Current Inventory And Exact Touchpoints

| Surface | Current touchpoints | Why this story must touch them |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core agent object | `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py` in `Agent.__init__`, `get_tool_schemas()`, `_execute_tools()`, `_make_spawn_self_tool()`, `to_dict()`, and `from_dict()` | All new config fields live on `Agent`, tool-schema injection happens here, and sub-agent/HITL behavior must be enforced here. |
| Core runner and events | `packages/exo-core/src/exo/runner.py` in `run()` and `_stream()`; `packages/exo-core/src/exo/types.py` in `StatusEvent`, `ToolResult`, `ToolResultEvent`, and `MCPProgressEvent` | Planning must run before executor turns, MCP progress gating is emitted here, and tool-result metadata must be surfaced here. |
| Serialization and parsing | `packages/exo-core/src/exo/config.py` (`AgentConfig`) and `packages/exo-core/src/exo/_internal/output_parser.py` (`parse_tool_arguments()`) | The new fields must survive `Agent.to_dict()/from_dict()` and injected args must be split away from executable kwargs here. |
| Distributed execution | `packages/exo-distributed/src/exo/distributed/models.py` (`TaskPayload.agent_config`), `worker.py`, `events.py`, and `temporal.py` | Distributed workers and Temporal rebuild agents from serialized config. Event transport must carry the new metadata and optional MCP progress without drift. |
| Exo Web storage/runtime | `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/migrations/008_create_agents.sql`, `026_create_agent_plans.sql`, `035_create_runs.sql`, `041_create_workflow_approvals.sql`, `routes/agents.py`, `services/agent_runtime.py`, `routes/plans.py`, `routes/approvals.py`, and the agent editor pages under `src/pages/agents/` | Web already stores `autonomous_mode` and planner records, but it does not store the new runtime controls. HITL approval storage is workflow-specific today and must not be reused blindly. |

## Decisions

### 1. Agent Config Fields

These fields are added to the core agent contract and serialized config:

| Field | Type | Default | Validation | Runtime contract |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `planning_enabled` | `bool` | `false` | none | Run a planner phase before the executor phase. |
| `planning_model` | `str \| null` | `null` | Must parse as a normal Exo model string when set. | When null, planning uses the executor model/provider. |
| `planning_instructions` | `str` | `""` | none | When empty, use Exo’s built-in planner prompt. |
| `budget_awareness` | `str \| null` | `null` | Only `per-message` or `limit:<0-100>` are valid. | Controls context-budget warnings and hard stops. |
| `hitl_tools` | `list[str]` | `[]` | Every name must exist on the agent after tool registration. | Matching tool calls pause for approval before execution. |
| `emit_mcp_progress` | `bool` | `true` | none | `false` suppresses `MCPProgressEvent` emission only. |
| `injected_tool_args` | `dict[str, str]` | `{}` | Keys must be valid JSON object property names; values are descriptions shown in tool schema. | Adds schema-only optional fields to every exposed tool. |
| `allow_parallel_subagents` | `bool` | `false` | none | Enables a dedicated parallel-subagent tool. |
| `max_parallel_subagents` | `int` | `3` | Must be `1..7`. | Caps the number of child jobs in a single parallel-subagent call. |

Exact code touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py`
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/config.py`
- `packages/exo-core/tests/test_serialization.py`
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/routes/agents.py`
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/services/agent_runtime.py`
- `packages/exo-web/src/pages/agents/new/index.astro`
- `packages/exo-web/src/pages/agents/[id]/edit.astro`

### 2. Planning Contract

`planning_enabled` introduces a planner phase, not a second persisted conversation.

Rules:

- The planner runs before the first executor model call.
- The planner may use the same tool schemas as the executor.
- Planner messages, planner tool chatter, and planner tool results never enter the executor `messages` list.
- Planner output is reduced to a structured internal plan artifact and optional run/debug metadata.
- `planning_model` is a pure override for the planner phase only; it never mutates `agent.model`.
- `planning_instructions` scopes only to the planner phase.

Exact touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/runner.py`: add a planner pre-pass before the normal execution loop.
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py`: surface planner fields on the agent and keep them in `to_dict()/from_dict()`.
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/routes/plans.py` and `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/services/planner.py`: keep existing user-managed `autonomous_mode` and `agent_plans` separate from the runtime planner.

Decision: do not reuse `agent_plans` for runtime planner transcripts. `agent_plans` is a user-facing, persistent web feature; runtime planning is ephemeral execution state.

### 3. Budget Awareness Contract

`budget_awareness` has exactly two enabled modes:

- `per-message`
- `limit:<0-100>`

Rules:

- `null` disables budget-aware behavior.
- `per-message` adds an advisory string to every assistant message and tool result that is surfaced back to the model.
- `limit:<n>` forces a compaction pass before the next model call whenever the context exceeds the configured percentage of the window.
- If compaction still cannot get the prompt below the configured limit, the run ends with a deterministic budget-limit message instead of making another provider call.

Exact touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/runner.py`: current token tracking and context windowing already live here.
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py`: `_get_context_window_tokens()` and `_update_system_token_info()` already exist and should be reused.
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/types.py`: the deterministic stop message should remain a normal result, not a hidden exception path.

### 4. Injected Tool Args Contract

`injected_tool_args` is schema-only and must never pollute executable kwargs.

Rules:

- `Agent.get_tool_schemas()` deep-copies each tool schema and merges every configured injected field as an optional property.
- The underlying `Tool.parameters` object is never mutated.
- `parse_tool_arguments()` must split raw model-returned args into:
  - executable `arguments`
  - `injected_args`
- Only executable `arguments` are passed to `tool.execute(**kwargs)`.
- `injected_args` are copied into tool-result metadata and approval records when relevant.

Exact touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py`: `get_tool_schemas()`
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/_internal/output_parser.py`: split injected args away from executable args
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/types.py`: carry injected args in tool-result metadata
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/services/agent_runtime.py`: preserve schema-only fields when building live agents from DB rows

Decision: `injected_tool_args` stays `dict[str, str]` rather than full JSON Schema so it round-trips cleanly through JSON, DB text storage, and distributed payloads without introducing per-provider schema drift in the first implementation.

### 5. HITL Tool Contract

`hitl_tools` is an allowlist of tool names already present on the agent.

Rules:

- Validation happens at agent construction, deserialization, and Exo Web save time.
- If a tool call targets a HITL-marked tool, Exo creates an approval request before executing the tool.
- The tool call returns one of three deterministic approval states:
  - `approved`
  - `rejected`
  - `timed_out`
- Approval state is recorded in tool-result metadata and in the streaming event.

Exact touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py`: gate tool execution inside `_execute_tools()`
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/types.py`: add approval fields to tool-result metadata
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/routes/approvals.py` and `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/migrations/041_create_workflow_approvals.sql`: current approval storage is workflow-specific
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/services/agent_runtime.py`: runtime adapter must create and poll approvals for agent runs

Decision: do not reuse `workflow_approvals` as-is. It references `workflow_runs(id)` and does not fit agent/runtime tool approvals. The implementation should introduce a run-scoped approval record that can serve both workflow and agent tool approvals, then reuse the existing approval UI against that broader storage.

### 6. Parallel Sub-Agent Contract

There are two sub-agent paths:

- `spawn_self(...)` for a single child
- a new parallel-subagent tool enabled by `allow_parallel_subagents`

Parent config:

- `allow_parallel_subagents=false` means the parallel-subagent tool is absent.
- `max_parallel_subagents` caps the number of child jobs per call and may never exceed `7`.

Child-call contract:

- `task: str` is required.
- `additional_context: str = ""` is optional.
- `tool_names: list[str] | null = null` optionally narrows the child tool set.
- `output_schema: dict[str, Any] | null = null` optionally declares a JSON Schema contract for the child result.
- `system_prompt: str = ""` is allowed on the parallel-subagent tool for per-child framing.

Rules:

- `tool_names`, when set, must be a strict subset of the parent’s child-safe tools.
- Child overrides affect only the child execution context and never mutate the parent agent.
- `output_schema` is JSON Schema, not an import path to a Pydantic class, because it must round-trip through tool calls and distributed payloads.
- Every child result is validated before aggregation.
- Aggregated parallel results are structured as per-job success/error entries, never free-form concatenated text.

Exact touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py`: `_make_spawn_self_tool()`
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/_internal/agent_group.py`: existing `asyncio.TaskGroup` pattern is the right concurrency primitive
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/types.py`: add structured child-result metadata as needed
- `packages/exo-web/src/pages/agents/[id]/edit.astro`: editor validation must reject values above `7`

Decision: keep child tool subsets and `output_schema` as call-time contracts, not agent-config fields. The parent agent config only decides whether parallel sub-agents are enabled and how many can run.

### 7. Tool-Result Metadata Contract

Add a new metadata object carried by both `ToolResult` and `ToolResultEvent`.

Proposed shape:

```python
class ToolResultMetadata(BaseModel):
    status: Literal["success", "error", "rejected", "timed_out"]
    started_at: float
    completed_at: float
    execution_time_ms: float
    approval_status: Literal["not_required", "approved", "rejected", "timed_out"]
    approval_id: str | None = None
    injected_args: dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    offloaded_artifact_id: str | None = None
```

Rules:

- `ToolResult.metadata` becomes the canonical runtime record.
- `ToolResultEvent.metadata` mirrors the same object.
- Existing `success`, `error`, and `duration_ms` fields on `ToolResultEvent` stay for backward compatibility in the first implementation slice.
- When a large tool result is offloaded, record the artifact id in metadata instead of requiring callers to parse the pointer string.

Exact touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/types.py`
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/agent.py`
- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/runner.py`
- `packages/exo-distributed/src/exo/distributed/events.py`
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/routes/runs.py`

### 8. MCP Progress Contract

`emit_mcp_progress` defaults to `true` for backward compatibility.

Rules:

- `false` suppresses only `MCPProgressEvent` emission.
- Tool execution still proceeds identically.
- Suppression happens in the runner after tool execution has drained MCP progress queues.

Exact touchpoints:

- `packages/exo-core/src/exo/runner.py`: current MCP queue draining is unconditional and must become flag-aware
- `packages/exo-distributed/src/exo/distributed/events.py`: `_EVENT_TYPE_MAP` currently omits `mcp_progress`
- `packages/exo-distributed/src/exo/distributed/temporal.py`: current Temporal activity collects only `TextEvent` and silently drops progress and tool-result events
- `packages/exo-web/src/exo_web/services/agent_runtime.py`: current streaming bridge only forwards text and usage to callers

Decision: `emit_mcp_progress` is purely an emission toggle. It is not a tool behavior toggle and it must not change the tool call/result contract.

## Serialized Agent-Config Example

Defaults:

- `planning_enabled=false`
- `planning_model=null`
- `planning_instructions=""`
- `budget_awareness=null`
- `hitl_tools=[]`
- `emit_mcp_progress=true`
- `injected_tool_args={}`
- `allow_parallel_subagents=false`
- `max_parallel_subagents=3`

Configured example:

```json
{
  "name": "ops-supervisor",
  "model": "openai:gpt-4o",
  "instructions": "Plan first, execute carefully, and escalate dangerous actions.",
  "max_steps": 12,
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "max_tokens": 4096,
  "planning_enabled": true,
  "planning_model": "openai:gpt-4o-mini",
  "planning_instructions": "Return a short numbered execution plan before acting.",
  "budget_awareness": "limit:70",
  "hitl_tools": ["deploy_service", "rotate_credentials"],
  "emit_mcp_progress": true,
  "injected_tool_args": {
    "ui_request_id": "Opaque UI correlation id exposed only in tool schemas.",
    "run_origin": "Short label for the caller surface, such as playground or workflow."
  },
  "allow_parallel_subagents": true,
  "max_parallel_subagents": 4
}
```

Behavior notes:

- If `planning_enabled` were `false`, `planning_model` and `planning_instructions` would be ignored.
- If `budget_awareness` were `null`, neither advisory strings nor hard budget stops would run.
- If `emit_mcp_progress` were `false`, the same MCP tools would run but no `mcp_progress` events would be emitted.
- If `allow_parallel_subagents` were `false`, the parallel-subagent tool would not be registered even if `max_parallel_subagents` remained `4`.

## Rejected Designs

These are explicit non-goals for implementation stories that depend on this memo.

- Reject planner-history mixing. Planner prompts, planner tool calls, and planner tool results must not be appended to executor message history and must not be persisted into `agent_plans`.
- Reject raw tool-kwarg pollution from injected fields. Injected schema-only fields are captured separately and never passed into `tool.execute(**kwargs)`.
- Reject parallel-subagent counts above `7`. Validation belongs in core agent construction, deserialization, Exo Web create/update, and per-call runtime checks.
- Reject `hitl_tools` names that are not present on the agent. Save-time and deserialize-time validation should fail fast.

## Implementation Order For Follow-On Stories

1. Extend `Agent`, `AgentConfig`, and `Agent.to_dict()/from_dict()` with the new scalar/list/map fields.
2. Add planner pre-pass, budget-awareness enforcement, and injected-arg splitting in core runner/parsing.
3. Add tool-result metadata and approval-aware tool execution in core types and agent execution.
4. Bring distributed worker, event transport, and Temporal execution to parity, including `mcp_progress`.
5. Add Exo Web DB columns, CRUD models, runtime wiring, approval storage, and editor validation.

This order minimizes interface churn because every later story can depend on one serialized agent contract and one tool-result metadata shape.
