# Porting Guide: agent-core (openJiuwen) → Exo

## 1. Introduction

**agent-core** is the core SDK of [openJiuwen](https://github.com/OpenJiuwen), a Chinese-origin open-source AI Agent framework (Apache 2.0, Python 3.11+). It provides a comprehensive, monolithic toolkit for building self-optimizing agents with features spanning LLM abstraction, multi-agent orchestration, Pregel-based graph execution, enterprise-grade RAG pipelines, context engineering, multi-dimensional memory, and security guardrails.

**Exo** is a modular Python monorepo that reimplements and extends agent-core's most valuable features as independent, composable packages. Rather than porting agent-core wholesale, Exo selectively adapted the strongest patterns — typed rails, context processors, memory evolution, retrieval pipelines — while replacing others with simpler alternatives (e.g., Swarm transfers instead of Pregel channels).

This guide documents every architectural decision made during the port, providing migration paths for developers familiar with either framework.

For a detailed feature-by-feature comparison, see [agent-core-vs-exo-analysis.md](../../agent-core-vs-exo-analysis.md).

## 2. Architecture Comparison

### agent-core: Single-Package Monolith

agent-core ships as a single `openjiuwen` package (~540+ files) where all features are bundled together:

```

## 3. Design Philosophy Differences

| Dimension | agent-core | Exo |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Package structure** | Single package, all-or-nothing | Modular monorepo, install what you need |
| **Resource management** | Global `Runner` singleton with registry | Dependency injection through package hierarchy |
| **Agent composition** | Inheritance-heavy (`ReActAgent` → `ControllerAgent`) | Composition via Swarm transfers + HookManager |
| **Workflow execution** | Pregel graph with super-steps, channels, barriers | Swarm DSL (`"a >> b >> c"`) + topological sort |
| **Context lifecycle** | Stateful `ContextManager` orchestrates all processing | Event-driven `ProcessorPipeline` — processors are independent |
| **Agent lifecycle guards** | `AgentRail` callbacks with untyped context dict | Typed `Rail` ABC with Pydantic event models |
| **Memory model** | Flat `MemoryItem` with 5 string types | Typed hierarchy (`SystemMemory`, `HumanMemory`, `AIMemory`, `ToolMemory`) |
| **Security** | Pluggable guardrail backends on callback framework | `BaseGuardrail` integrates via `HookManager` |
| **Evolution/optimization** | LLM-driven Operators (prompt, tool, memory tuning) | Textual gradient optimization + genetic algorithms |
| **Observability** | Session tracing with spans | Full OpenTelemetry (logging, tracing, metrics, cost tracking) |
| **Provider support** | 4 providers (OpenAI-compatible, DashScope, SiliconFlow) | 11 providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Vertex, Ollama, etc.) |

## 6. Acknowledgments

This porting effort builds extensively on the work of the [openJiuwen](https://github.com/OpenJiuwen) project and its contributors. The agent-core SDK represents a thoughtful and comprehensive approach to AI agent development, and many of Exo's features — particularly the typed rail system, context engine processors, memory evolution strategies, and retrieval pipeline architecture — were directly inspired by or adapted from openJiuwen's designs.
